Very first repo with ideas and drafts

Hi there! 
My hobbies are cooking, painting, reading, drawing and traveling.
I would like to visit South America next fall and maybe Europe nest year.
Between my favorite book are "Eva Luna" by Isabel Allende, any of Julio Cortazar and "Beggars in Spain" by Nancy Kres
I am taking a course about scientific illustration because I really love to draw and wish to make it useful
Well, how about you?
